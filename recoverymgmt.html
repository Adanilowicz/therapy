    <p>
    	One imporant recovery management strategy (see below) is having a therapist, coach and/or advocate. As a therapist I help you to:
        <ul class="order-list">
        
         	<li>Gain clarity about substance use or compulsive behavior in your life</li>
            <li>Develop and sustain motivation</li>
            <li>Navigate Recovery Management holistically</li>
             <li>Use coping skills for cravings and emotional upsets</li>
             <li>Address old traumas and unhelpful beliefs</li>
             <li>Live a more balanced life and connect to who and what is important to you.</li>
             
    	</ul>
    </p>
   
    <p>
Each person's recovery journey is as unique as they are and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. I work with you to determine what is best for your individual path in relation to your values and goals. I am open to harm-reduction approaches, where appropriate. I do not offer moderation management, but do work with clients who are prescribed medications such as buprenorhpine (Suboxone), acamprosate and naltrexone (Vivitrol) as part of a medication assisted recovery (MAR) approach. 
</p>
<p>
I strive to create a stigma-free atmosphere of compassion and understanding for those with whom I work. I understand that different people are in different stages and have different circumstances and histories. In addressing addictive behavior I aim to cultivate a space of natural curiosity, not shame and fear. I honor wherever you are at in your journey right now.</p>

 	<h4 class="cheesehead">What's With the Cheese?</h4>
    	<p>
        I subscribe to Dr. Kevin McCauley's <a href="https://www.theinstituteforaddictionstudy.org/recovery-management/">"Swiss Cheese Model"</a> of Recovery Management that involves various things you do, or slices of Swiss cheese, to help you on your journey. Each cheese slice is a strategy that helps keep you safe from returning to use/acting out. They are:
        <ol class="order-list">
        	<li>Treatment (residential or outpatient)</li>
            <li>Mutual Aid Groups (12 Step, SMART Recovery, etc.)</li>
            <li>Therapist, Coach and/or Advocate</li>
            <li>Safe Housing</li>
            <li>Relapse Plan</li>
            <li>Ongoing Testing (UAs)</li>
            <li>Getting back to/starting Career/Education</li>
            <li>Seeing a doctor who knows about addiction</li>
            <li>Medications (Suboxone, Vivitrol, acamprosate, etc)</li>
            <li>Having FUN!!... regularly : )</li>
        
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        But why Swiss cheese? Well, the thing about Swiss cheese is: it has <b>holes</b>. Like Swiss cheese slices, each of the above strategies, by themselves, are great, but not perfect-- they have holes that represent areas of risk. However, when you take slices of Swiss cheese and stack them on top of each other, what happens to the holes? They close up and dissapear! Risk of return to use and other negative outcomes goes down.
        </p>
        
        <p> Evidence suggests (Kelly and White, 2011) that people who use multiple recovey strategies at the same time, like the ones above,  have higher rates of sustaining recovery. So, <b>stacking your cheese slices by doing multiple recovery practices at the same time increases the likelihood of sustaining your recovery.</b>

<h4 class="cheesehead">Common Struggles, Common Strengths</h4>
<p>
Many people that use substances, including alcohol, or engage in behaviors that become addictive (like pornography, internet gaming, and gambling) began doing so for good reasons. It probably felt great, relieved pain or stress, was fun, connected them more deeply with others, creative endeavors or helped them focus themselves in some way that was important to them. At some point, however, the costs began to outweigh the benefits. Issues come up that were not there at first and the biological functions of dependence and withdrawal avoidance emerge - and no one plans for that!</p>

<p>People at this point usually need help in getting clear about their behavior in light of what they really care about. They are <i>ambivalent</i> about using, AND that's good! <b>No one is 100% about change AND they don't need to be!</b> If they feel they want to change, <b>all they need to be is to be at 51%</b> The part that loves using and acting out doesn't go away, nor should it - that is a valuable part of you. It's simply that the part of you that wants to do what really matters to you gets stronger.

<p>The fact that using drugs is criminalized in our society usually doesn't help many (though many do stop because of mounting criminal conseqeunces) and some people entangled in the criminal justice system, may get </p>
