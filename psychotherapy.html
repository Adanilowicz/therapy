    	<h4 class="therapy-h">My Thoughts on Therapy</h4>
        
    	<p> Psychotherapy, while certainly not the only tool for transformation, can be a powerful vehicle in helping you to realize change, insight, self-compassion, increased awareness and a sense of greater freedom and flexibility. 
<br /></p>
<p>Good psychotherapy is deep. It is reparative, restorative and active. It can also be challenging, as crossing over difficult psychological and emotional terrain requires willingness to glimpse our own shadow material and painful content from the past. It short, it requires courage. However, good therapy does not push individuals into places they are unwilling to go or that feel unsafe. It honors natural protective boundaries. Respecting courage and boundaries, good therapy opens us to depths and horizons we may not have imagined, yet somehow, deep down, sensed as possible. </p>

<h4 class="therapy-h">Approaching an Integral Approach</h4>
<p> In my view, there are four general levels that therapy modalities impact: 1) the outer (behavior), 2)the Self (insight), 3)the body (somatic) and the 4) social systems individuals live within (social). Some therapies focus on particular levels, while others address multiple levels. For example, behavioral approaches like contigency management are all about behavior, while psychodynamic approaches are primarily geared toward insight and self-knowledge. I believe that each of these levels are key elements of the human experience. While I draw heavily on mindfulness-based behavioral approaches (ACT primarily), I incorporate elements from each category in an effort to provide an integral approach to the WHOLE person.</p>

         <h4 class="therapy-h">A little about EMDR</h4>
         I regularly utilize Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) in my work with clients, particularly those with trauma histories, though EMDR can be a powerful tool for other issues like addiction, chronic pain and, more generally, anxiety and mood regulation issues. EMDR helps clients dive deep more quickly than standard talk therapy. In my own experience, I've found EMDR to be a profound tool in unlocking patterns that, though they had their place historically, have become stuck and are no longer useful. I have trained in Attachment-Focused EMDR with Laurel Parnell, PhD, and utilize this more flexible and developmentally-based approach when indicated.

          <h4 class="therapy-h">Context Matters</h4>
         <p> 
     I work to understand how the people whom I serve have been impacted by social, cultural, economic, and historical systems, institutions and events. As a cisgender straight white male from the South I strive to understand and address how my multiple points of privilege, and my own history influence my perspective and my work.  While one's perspective can never be completely neutral, I commit to listening to you from a place of openness, curiosity and humility, honoring your unique identity and acknowledging the various forces that have influenced your experience, struggles and strengths. </p> 
      <p> 
      <h4>In Sum:</h4>
    I find therapy to be endlessly compelling, and feel profoundly privileged to be present for my clients' healing journeys. I hold this work to be sacred. </p>
